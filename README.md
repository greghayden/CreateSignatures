A WinForms Program to create signatures from individual words
Imports a file of words, reads each word (one per line),
creates a signature (word, length, product and sum) for each line
writes the signature to a list, then outputs the list to a file
located in the user's Documents folder.
 
A signature is a combination of the word, number of characters,
product and sum of each character's ASCII value.
e.g. "ababua, 6, 111468, 611"
