A WinForms Program to convert individual words into signatures.

A signature is a combination of the word, number of characters,
product and sum of each character's ASCII value.
(e.g. "ababua, 6, 111468, 611").

The user slects a text file using a FileOpen dialog box. The file
contains a list of english words (one per line). The program then
creates a signature (word, length, product and sum) for each line
and writes each signature to a list, then outputs the list to a 
file with the name "signatures.txt, located in the user's Documents 
folder.

The ultimate purpose of the signatures file is to be used in unjumble programs.
